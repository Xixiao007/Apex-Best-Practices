# Meaningful Names

>There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things. -- Phil Karlton

As Apex programmers, we need to give names everywhere in software, such as variables, functions, classes, parameters, triggers etc.. We do so much of it, yet few of us consider it important.

Either good names or bad names computers don't care. They execute regardless how things are named. This gives programmers execuses to not put good names. After all, the program runs as expected, why to do the extra? This is wrong.

Why is it wrong? Simple. Because programs are reviewed, maintained, extended by people, including yourself! In another word, we are crafting programs first for people, then for computers. The easier it is to understand what your software is doing, the more appeciation, you get.

Professional programmers know the criticality of giving good names and are willing to spend time to think, pick, repick, repick (again) names to improve the readability. Do practice your skill on naming stuff from now on. it pays off soon.

"OK, I got you. But what are good names?" you may start asking. Good question! Let's now check the features of it together.
