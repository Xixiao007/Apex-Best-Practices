Which door presents your code at the moment? And which door are you after?

Unless you are living in an absolute vaccumed world, your code is reviewed by others. Our programming journey all starts somewhere, we all have writen bad, smelly code. 

As Salesforce Apex programmer, how do we improve and write better code, write the code that is clean, simply, easy to understand, scale, and change?

My answer is "practice with intention". It comprises two parts: knowledge and work. Both are important. Missing one, mission fails.

<b>Knowledge</b> is about comprehending the platforms, best practices, principles and patterns of Apex language. It enables you to tell the right from the wrong. Without the knowledge, you might think "Apex is just like JAVA or C#", you likely are doing useless practices, or worse, toxic practices that create Salesforce solutions doomed to be failures.


<b>Work</b> is about grinding the knowledge into your muscle memory until it runs natually in your blood just like riding a bike without thinking much of the riding techniques anymore. To achieve this, you need to undertake practices. A lot of practices.

In this booklet I will cover many knowledge points, all of which are absorbed from various resources. Also, I attempt to give enough real life Apex code samples to complement each knowledge point, in order to help you better understand and digest.
